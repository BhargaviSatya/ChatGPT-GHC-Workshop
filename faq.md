## 🧠 Technical Questions

### Q: What's the difference between a basic prompt and an engineered prompt?
**A:** 
- **Basic prompt:** "Explain inflation"
- **Engineered prompt:** "You are a financial advisor. Explain inflation to a 25-year-old who just started their first job. Focus on practical impact and include one actionable tip. Keep it under 200 words."

The engineered prompt provides role, context, audience, and format specifications.

### Q: How do I know if my prompt is good?
**A:** A good prompt should:
- Get the response you want on the first try
- Be specific and clear
- Include relevant context
- Specify the desired output format
- Produce consistent results

### Q: Can I use the same prompt for different scenarios?
**A:** You can use templates, but you should customize them for each specific situation. The role, context, and requirements will likely need adjustment.
